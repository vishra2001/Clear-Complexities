# About Me

Hello and welcome to my Technical Writing Portfolio! My name is Gayathri Surianarayanan, and I am a Senior Technical Writer with over 9 years of experience in crafting user-centric documentation for diverse audiences. I specialize in translating complex technical information into clear, concise, and actionable content for both enterprise and consumer software products. With a strong background in UX writing, Content Design, and Information Architecture, I am passionate about creating seamless documentation experiences that empower users.

# Overview

This portfolio serves as a comprehensive collection of my technical writing expertise. Here, you will find evidence of my work ranging from high-level deployment and configuration guides for Cisco’s networking solutions to detailed API documentation and microcopy for SaaS platforms. My work showcases my ability to break down intricate system architectures into reader-friendly content that drives product adoption and reduces support overhead.

# My Approach

I believe that technical documentation is a critical component of the user experience. My approach is deeply collaborative and data-driven; I work closely with UX designers, software engineers, and product managers to ensure that documentation is integrated into the product lifecycle from the design phase. I am an early adopter of modern workflows, utilizing Gen AI to increase efficiency and leveraging visual storytelling tools like Lumen5 to cater to visual learners. My goal is always to provide the right information, in the right format, at the right time.
